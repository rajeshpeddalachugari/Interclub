                        <p>It's a famous quote <b>"A sound body has a sound mind"</b> depcits that the health of the body is essential for success in life. Sports are commonly defined as an organized, competitive and skillful physical activity requiring commitment and passion to play.</p>
                        <p>In Games & Sports the physical and mental capabilities are the sole or primary determiner of the outcome. If one is bodily fit, one feels capable of hard endeavor with greater confidence. Sports also teach teamwork giving oneself a sense of pride and accomplishment.
